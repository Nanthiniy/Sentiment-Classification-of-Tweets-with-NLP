# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This project performs **sentiment analysis on Twitter data** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. It classifies tweets as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques for high accuracy.

## 📊 Results

* Achieved high accuracy using fine-tuned BERT.
* Model effectively distinguishes between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in tweets.
* Example output visualization:

| Sentiment | Example Tweet               |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Positive  | “I love this movie!”        |
| Negative  | “This was a waste of time.” |
| Neutral   | “The event is tomorrow.”    |
